Usage:

    mm-compiler {<option>|<file>} ...
    mm-compiler run <file> ...

This program provides commands to lex, parses and compile MicroMorpho programs,
in addition to executing them using the Morpho Virtual Machine.

When invoked with the first argument `run', this program is used in run mode.
In run mode, the input file(s) are executed using the Morpho Virtual Machine.
Files to be executed must have the extension `.mexe'. If an argument
does not have the extension `.mexe', it is added.
No options are allowed (except for `-h'/`--help') in run mode.

If no files are present or invalid options are detected, an error is thrown.
Files are processed one at a time, from left to right.

By convention, an argument consisting of a single hyphen (`-')
is interpreted as an ordinary non-option argument, which specifies
input from or output to the standard input and output streams.

If not specified using the option `-o'/`--output', the default output
files of programs are obtained by changing the extension of the
corresponding input file to `.mexe'.

Options are applied globally and their order does not matter
(with the exception of multiple invocations of `-o'/`--output').

Options:
    -h, -?, --help              Show this help text and exit. If this option is
                                present, all other arguments are ignored.
    -i, --info                  Show information regarding the LALR(1) state machine
                                this compiler uses to parse input files.
                                This is quite a large file, so the use of a pager
                                is recommended. If this option is present,
                                all other arguments (except for `-h' or `--help')
                                are ignored.
    -s {tokens|ast|masm},       Specifies an intermediate stage of compilation
    --show={tokens|ast|masm}    to output, instead of producing an executable file.
                                Only one invocation of this option is allowed.
                                Outputs to standard output by default.
                                    tokens: Lexes input and outputs the resulting
                                            tokens along with their positions and
                                            matching lexemes.
                                    ast:    Parses input and outputs the resulting
                                            syntax tree.
                                    masm:   Compiles input to Morpho machine code
                                            and outputs the result.
    -o <file>{,<file>},         Takes a comma-seperated list of file paths and
    --output=<file>{,<file>}    configures output files accordingly. Input files
                                and corresponding output files are paired
                                by order of appearence. Multiple invocations of
                                this option append to the list of output files.
                                If the list of output files is longer than the
                                list of input files, the trailing output files
                                are ignored. If it is shorter, the remaining
                                input files are mapped to their default outputs.
