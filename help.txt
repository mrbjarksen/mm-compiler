Usage:

    mm-compiler {<option>|<file>} ...

Lexes, parses and/or compiles a MicroMorpho program into Morpho machine code.
Results are written to standard output.

Arguments starting with `-' are treated as options, all others as file paths.
If no files are present, or conflicting options are detected, an error is thrown.
If more than one file is given, their individual results are concatenated.

Options:
    -h, --help                  Show this help text and exit.
                                If this option is present, all other arguments
                                are ignored.
    --show={tokens|ast|masm}    Choose what output to show. Defaults to `masm'.
                                    tokens: Lexes input and outputs the resulting
                                            tokens along with their positions and
                                            matching lexemes.
                                    ast:    Parses input and outputs the resulting
                                            syntax tree.
                                    masm:   Compiles input to Morpho machine code
                                            and outputs the result.
